Insurance Claims Analysis - PowerBI

Analyzing insurance claims data is crucial for understanding the dynamics of a company that sells auto insurance. This analysis aims to address key questions:

1. Which products generate the highest losses?
2. Which customer segments file the most claims?
3. What are the total number of claims over time, including monthly and yearly trends?

To begin, I calculated the loss ratio using the formula: Loss Ratio = Total Claims Paid / Total Premium Earned. Typically, auto insurance has a loss ratio of 1.25, indicating that claims exceed premiums by 25%. The interpretation of the loss ratio is as follows:
- < 0.5: Very profitable
- 0.50 – 0.80: Healthy
- 0.80 – 1.00: Risky
- > 1.0: Loss-making

To analyze the age categories filing claims, I utilized a histogram to show the distribution, revealing that middle-aged customers file the most claims. Regarding the time series analysis of claims over time, no significant seasonal trends were observed.

Additionally, the analysis includes insights into which car models are contributing to the company's losses, number of fraud claims a pie chart to breakdown the percentages of claims severity etc.

There are numerous other analyses that can be conducted with this data, such as examining how long after purchasing a policy customers typically file their first claim and identifying customers with unusually high claim frequency.
